Clean code 

1. function/class -- small and focused, only does one thing , max 2 args
2. run all tests
3. no duplicates, redundant details -->minimize number of classes
4. meaningful name, no confusing names, one word per concept (either retrieve or get NOT both) 
   -> class noun, method verb --> codes should be self explanatory without commenting
5. keep if else statment to only one line -> function call 


Common software engineering principles:
Test driven development: write test then function
Domain driven development: talk to domain experts, use domain specific (business) terminology, and domain modeling 
SOLID: for OODP, single, loosely coupled
Clean code 
Agile: iterative, incremental, adaptive planning, early delivery, continual improvement, flexible response to changes
VS waterfall: has different phases (development, test) while agile does in each iteration
